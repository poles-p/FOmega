System $F_{\omega}$ to rachunek będący rozszerzeniem $\lambda_{\omega}$ oraz systemu $F$.
Wszystkie trzy wywodzą się z rachunku lambda z typami prostymi. Termy($t$) oraz typy($T$) definiujemy w $\lambda_{\rightarrow}$ następująco: \\ \\
\begin{tabular}{| l c r |}
  \hline
  t ::= &  &  \\
   & $x$ & \textit{zmienne}  \\
   & $\lambda x:T.t$ & \textit{abstrakcja} \\
   & tt & \textit{aplikacja} \\
   & & \\
  T ::= &  &  \\
   & $X$ & \textit{zmienna typowa} \\
   & $T \rightarrow T$ & \textit{typ funkcji} \\
  \hline
\end{tabular} \\

System F jest systemem, w którym dodatkowo, oprócz termów zależnych od termów, mamy termy zależne od typów. Z systemu F dziedziczymy w $F_{\omega}$ takie własności jak: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item abstrakcję i aplikację typową w termach: \\
\begin{tabular}{| l c r |}
  \hline
  t ::= & $\cdots$ &  \\
   & $\lambda x::K.t$ & \textit{abstrakcja typowa} \\
   & t[T] & \textit{aplikacja typowa} \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}

    \item  oraz typ uniwersalny: \\
\begin{tabular}{| l c r |}
  \hline
  T ::= & $\cdots$ &  \\
   & $\forall X::K$ & \textit{typ uniwersalny} \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}

\end{itemize}

Główną cechą systemu $\lambda_{\omega}$ jest to, że typy zależą od innych typów. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item kostruktory typowe \\
\begin{tabular}{| l c r |}
   \hline
   T ::= & $\cdots$ &  \\
   & $\lambda X::K.T$ & \textit{konstruktor abstrakcji typowej} \\
   & $T T$ & \textit{konstruktor aplikacji typowej} \\
   \hline
\end{tabular}
    \item rodzaje \\
\begin{tabular}{| l c r |}
  \hline
  K ::= &  &   \\
   & $\ast$ & \textit{rodzaj wszystkich typów} \\
   & $K \Rightarrow K$ & \textit{???} \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{itemize} 



\emph{Konstruktory rodzaju} definiujemy następująco:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\frac{X::K \in \Gamma}{\Gamma \vdash X::K}$
        \item $\frac{\Gamma \vdash T_1 :: K_{1} \Rightarrow K_{2} \hspace{1em} \Gamma \vdash T_2 :: K_{1}}{\Gamma \vdash T_1 T_2 :: K_{2}}$
        \item $\frac{\Gamma \vdash X :: K_1 \hspace{1em} \Gamma \vdash T :: K_2}{\Gamma \vdash \lambda X::K. T :: K_{1} \Rightarrow K_{2}}$
        \item $\frac{\Gamma \vdash X :: K \hspace{1em} \Gamma \vdash T :: \ast}{\Gamma \vdash \forall X::K. T :: \ast}$
        \item $\frac{\Gamma \vdash T_1 : \ast \hspace{1em} \Gamma \vdash T_2 : \ast}{T_1 \rightarrow T_2 : \ast}$
    \end{itemize}


\begin{theorem}
\emph{Typem} nazywamy konstruktor rodzaju $\ast$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
No o podstawieniu konstruktora za zmienną konstruktorową można napisać albo nie. Tutaj można też wrzucić kod.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\alpha [\beta := \phi]= \begin{cases}  \alpha & \beta=\alpha \\ \beta & \text{w.p.p} \end{cases}$
        \item $(\vartheta \sigma) [\beta := \phi] = \vartheta [\beta := \phi] \sigma [\beta := \phi]$
        \item $\forall \alpha \sigma [\beta := \phi]= \begin{cases} \forall \alpha \sigma & \beta=\alpha \text{ lub } \beta \notin FV(\sigma)\\ \forall \alpha \sigma [\beta := \phi] & \alpha \notin FV(\phi)  \text{ i } \beta \in FV(\sigma) \end{cases}$
        \item $\lambda \alpha \sigma [\beta := \phi]= \begin{cases} \lambda \alpha \sigma & \beta=\alpha \text{ lub } \beta \notin FV(\sigma)\\ \lambda \alpha \sigma [\beta := \phi] & \alpha \notin FV(\phi)  \text{ i } \beta \in FV(\sigma) \end{cases}$
    \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

no i konstruktory są silnie normalizowalne, własność churcha-rossera zachodzi...

\begin{theorem}
Reguły przepisywania typów w systemie $F_{\omega}$ w wersji Curry'ego standardowe, oprócz: \\

$\frac{\Gamma \vdash M : \forall \alpha \sigma}{\Gamma \vdash M : nf(\sigma [ \alpha := \tau ])}$

\end{theorem}


Nierozstzygalne są problemy:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item sprawdzania typu: dane $\Gamma, M, \tau$, Czy $\Gamma \vdash M : \tau$
        \item typowalność: dane M, Czy $\exists \Gamma \tau . \Gamma \vdash M : \tau$
    \end{itemize}
